# List of AI Detectors for Images, Videos & Audio

Welcome to the 'List of AI Detectors for Images, Videos & Audio.'

This list is a collection of advanced tools that help you detect AI-generated media (including deepfakes) on the internet. It's perfect for website developers, AI researchers, and curious individuals, as well as anyone who wants to tell the difference between human-created and AI-generated media.

We've assembled and organized these tools alphabetically and labeled them with corresponding categories to make it easy for you to find the tool you need for your next project.

Explore this resource to find the right AI detectors for your needs and join us in promoting cooperation and recognition within the AI community.

**NOTE**: This list is updated once a month. Most of the tools offer some kind of freemium option. However, as this is an emerging area of technology, good completely free tools are hard to find. For the latest AI detectors, you may visit the original source listed in the next section. Remember that no AI detector is perfect for every job, and always use your best judgment.
